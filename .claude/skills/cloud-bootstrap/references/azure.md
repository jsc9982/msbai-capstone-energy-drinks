# Azure Reference

## User Prerequisites (First-Time Setup)

The user needs **Owner** or **User Access Administrator + Contributor** role on the Azure subscription, plus **Application Administrator** in Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) to create service principals.

## Team Member Prerequisites (Adding to Existing Setup)

The user needs **Application Administrator** (or **Cloud Application Administrator**) in Entra ID to add a client secret to the existing app registration. No subscription-level role is needed since roles are already assigned to the service principal.

## Key Limits

Each team member gets their own client secret on the same application/service principal. The number is **not unlimited**: Microsoft caps the entries across an application's manifest collections, `passwordCredentials` included, at a shared total ([manifest limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/reference-app-manifest#manifest-limits)), so secrets left behind by departed members and rotations count against it. Add Team Member lists the existing secrets first; remove expired or departed members' secrets (see "Secret Management") before adding more.

## CLI Installation

The Claude Code on the Web sandbox may not have `az` pre-installed. Use this script to install it:

```bash
if ! command -v az &> /dev/null; then
  for dir in /usr/bin /usr/local/bin /home/user/bin; do
    if [ -x "$dir/az" ]; then export PATH="$dir:$PATH"; break; fi
  done
fi
if ! command -v az &> /dev/null; then
  if ! curl -sSL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash; then
    echo "WARNING: Azure CLI install failed."
  fi
fi
```

### SessionStart Hook

After setup completes, create a SessionStart hook that installs the CLI **and** authenticates automatically. Create `.claude/hooks/cloud-auth.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Claude Code on the Web only: each session is its own container. Locally,
# `az login` writes the identity into the OS user's shared Azure CLI cache, so
# concurrent sessions would overwrite each other's principal and subscription;
# local users keep their own `az login`.
if [ "${CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE:-}" != "true" ]; then exit 0; fi
# Log out an earlier activation in this container (az keeps its login in a
# persistent token cache) whenever this run exits without renewing it
trap '[ "${AZ_ACTIVATED:-}" = 1 ] || { command -v az >/dev/null 2>&1 && az logout >/dev/null 2>&1 || true; }; rm -f /tmp/credentials.json' EXIT

Then add to `.claude/settings.json` (create the file and directories if needed):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/cloud-auth.sh\"",
            "timeout": 300
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If `.claude/settings.json` already exists, merge the `SessionStart` hook into the existing `hooks` object. Commit both `.claude/hooks/cloud-auth.sh` and `.claude/settings.json`.

## Bootstrap Token Command

Tell the user to run locally:

```bash
az login
az account set --subscription SUBSCRIPTION_ID

# Print both tokens so they can be pasted back into the session:
# ARM token — for resource management and role assignments
echo "ARM_TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --query accessToken -o tsv)"
# Graph token — for app registrations, service principals, client secrets
echo "GRAPH_TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --resource-type ms-graph --query accessToken -o tsv)"
```

The user pastes both lines; set `ARM_TOKEN` and `GRAPH_TOKEN` from them in the session.

Both tokens are valid for ~1 hour. **Important:** ARM tokens are NOT valid for Microsoft Graph API calls, and vice versa. Use the correct token for each endpoint.

## API Approach

In the usual remote setup, the user signs in on their own machine and pastes `ARM_TOKEN` and `GRAPH_TOKEN`; the `az` CLI in the sandbox is **not** signed in, and its commands do not read those variables. So use the REST calls with the pasted tokens, and use the CLI snippets only when `az account show` succeeds here (the CLI in this environment is itself signed in). The CLI snippets below check this and stop otherwise. REST calls:
- **ARM operations** (role assignments, subscriptions): `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARM_TOKEN"` against `https://management.azure.com`
- **Graph operations** (app registrations, service principals, secrets): `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRAPH_TOKEN"` against `https://graph.microsoft.com`

## Create Service Principal

```bash
# CLI path only: the az CLI here must itself be signed in (see API Approach);
# with pasted tokens, use the REST path below instead
az account show >/dev/null 2>&1 \
  || { echo "ERROR: az is not signed in here; use the REST path with ARM_TOKEN/GRAPH_TOKEN."; exit 1; }

# A fixed display name such as "claude-agent" can make create-for-rbac modify an

The tenant ID is collected first, before any Graph call creates anything, so a missing tenant never leaves a half-created application or a live secret on disk.

The trap above only covers this block: the agent may run each snippet in its own shell, where a trap cannot follow. Role grants, encryption, and the commit still come after it, so **if any later setup step fails, run the rollback below before retrying**. Otherwise the application and its live client secret stay behind, possibly with some roles already granted, and the name-collision check blocks a retry with the same name.

# never leaves a live secret behind (provider-aware: in multi-provider mode
# these live in the matching providers[] entry).

**Note:** The `.cloud-config.json` for Azure should also store `tenant` alongside the other fields.

## Secret Management

Resolve the application first (later sessions have no `OBJECT_ID` in scope), then list its client secrets (requires `$GRAPH_TOKEN`):

```bash
APP_ID=$(jq -r '(if .providers then (.providers[] | select(.provider=="azure") | .service_account) else (select(.provider=="azure") | .service_account) end) // empty' .cloud-config.json)
OBJECT_ID=$(curl -sS --fail -G "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications" \
  --data-urlencode "\$filter=appId eq '$APP_ID'" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRAPH_TOKEN" | jq -r '.value[0].id // empty')
[ -n "$OBJECT_ID" ] || { echo "ERROR: could not resolve the application for appId '$APP_ID'."; exit 1; }

curl -sS --fail "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/$OBJECT_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRAPH_TOKEN" | jq '.passwordCredentials[] | {displayName, keyId, endDateTime}'
```

Remove a team member's secrets (if they leave); the block resolves the application itself. This removes every secret the member still has: their current one (`key_ids` in `.cloud-config.json`) and any old ones in their `revoke_pending` list. Each ID leaves the config as soon as Graph confirms its removal (HTTP 204), and the credential file goes only when none remain, so the repo never drops the record of a secret that is still live. It also removes every secret labelled `claude-code-<email>` (the label setup gives each member's secret), which covers members added before `key_ids` existed; a secret the config records for another member is left alone. For an unlabelled secret, set `KEY_ID` to it and, once the user has confirmed it is the member's, `CONFIRM_KEY=1`; a `KEY_ID` the config records for another member is refused.

```bash
MEMBER_EMAIL="departed-user@example.com"
# Resolve the application here too: this block may run in a fresh shell
APP_ID=$(jq -r '(if .providers then (.providers[] | select(.provider=="azure") | .service_account) else (select(.provider=="azure") | .service_account) end) // empty' .cloud-config.json)

## Activate (Subsequent Sessions)

After decrypting credentials to `/tmp/credentials.json`:

```bash
# Only a credential for the configured application (not a stale or copied one)
APP_CFG=$(jq -r '(if .providers then (.providers[] | select(.provider=="azure") | .service_account) else (select(.provider=="azure") | .service_account) end) // empty' .cloud-config.json)

# commands would otherwise run as it although this activation failed

  || { az logout >/dev/null 2>&1; rm -f /tmp/credentials.json; echo "ERROR: the credential is not for application ${APP_CFG:-configured in .cloud-config.json}; logged out."; exit 1; }
# ...and only this member's own secret: key_ids maps each member to theirs (an

    elif ($m[$e] // "") != "" and ($m[$e] | split("/") | last) != $k and ((.rotating // {})[$e] // "") == "" then "its secret differs from the key_ids entry for this member"
    else "ok" end' .cloud-config.json 2>/dev/null)
[ "$WHY" = ok ] || { az logout >/dev/null 2>&1; rm -f /tmp/credentials.json; echo "ERROR: the credential was not activated: ${WHY:-its secret could not be checked}; logged out."; exit 1; }
az login --service-principal \
  --username "$(jq -r .appId /tmp/credentials.json)" \
  --password "$(jq -r .password /tmp/credentials.json)" \
  --tenant "$(jq -r .tenant /tmp/credentials.json)" \
  || { az logout >/dev/null 2>&1; rm -f /tmp/credentials.json; echo "ERROR: az login failed (the secret may be revoked or expired); logged out."; exit 1; }

# Provider-aware subscription: in multi-provider repos the subscription id is in
# the matching providers[] entry, not at top-level .project_id.

  || { az logout; rm -f /tmp/credentials.json; echo "ERROR: could not select the configured subscription."; exit 1; }

rm -f /tmp/credentials.json
```

## Verify (Smoke Test)

After activating credentials, run this lightweight check to confirm they work:

```bash
az account show --query "{name:name, id:id}" -o json
```

If this fails, the credentials may be expired or the client secret may have been revoked. Re-run the **Authenticate** flow or ask the user to check the service principal.
