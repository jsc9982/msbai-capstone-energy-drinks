# GCP Reference

## User Prerequisites (First-Time Setup)

The user's GCP account needs **Owner**, or **Service Account Admin + Service Account Key Admin + Project IAM Admin**, on the project. Service Account Admin alone cannot create keys: `iam.serviceAccountKeys.create` is in Service Account Key Admin.

## Team Member Prerequisites (Adding to Existing Setup)

The user's GCP account needs **Service Account Key Admin** on the project (or on the specific service account). This is a narrower permission than what the first user needs.

## Key Limits

GCP allows **10 keys per service account**. Keep one slot free: Credential Rotation creates and verifies the replacement before deleting the old key, so a member can rotate only while the account has fewer than 10 keys. In practice that is **9 team members** per service account (fewer while old keys await revocation in `revoke_pending`). Before adding a member or rotating, count the keys ("Key Management" below) and delete unused ones; if all 10 are in use, rotate by the compromise ordering (revoke first, accepting a brief lockout) or create a second service account.

## Bootstrap Token Command

Tell the user to run in [Google Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com) (click the ">_" terminal icon in the Cloud Console) or on their local machine if they have `gcloud` installed:

```bash
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
gcloud auth print-access-token
```

This produces a token valid for ~1 hour.

## CLI Installation

The Claude Code on the Web sandbox does not have `gcloud` pre-installed. Use this script to install it:

```bash
if ! command -v gcloud &> /dev/null; then
  # Check common install paths first
  for dir in /home/user/google-cloud-sdk/bin /usr/lib/google-cloud-sdk/bin /usr/local/google-cloud-sdk/bin; do
    if [ -x "$dir/gcloud" ]; then export PATH="$dir:$PATH"; break; fi
  done
fi
if ! command -v gcloud &> /dev/null; then
  INSTALLER=$(curl -sSL https://sdk.cloud.google.com 2>/dev/null) || true
  if [ -z "$INSTALLER" ] || ! echo "$INSTALLER" | bash -s -- --disable-prompts --install-dir=/home/user; then
    echo "WARNING: gcloud SDK install failed."
  else
    export PATH="/home/user/google-cloud-sdk/bin:$PATH"
  fi
fi
```

### SessionStart Hook

After setup completes, create a SessionStart hook that installs the CLI **and** authenticates automatically. Create `.claude/hooks/cloud-auth.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Claude Code on the Web only: each session is its own container. On a shared
# local machine the fixed key path and gcloud's active account would leak
# between concurrent sessions, so local users keep their own gcloud login.
if [ "${CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE:-}" != "true" ]; then exit 0; fi
# Undo an earlier activation in this container (gcloud's stored account, the
# ADC key file, the persisted export) whenever this run exits without renewing
# it: a removed passphrase or a broken file must disable repository auth, not
# leave the previous session's identity in place.
ADC_KEY="/tmp/gcp-adc-credentials.json"
# Note the earlier account now: a replacement key moved over the file before a
# failed login would otherwise hide which cached account still needs revoking

Then add to `.claude/settings.json` (create the file and directories if needed):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/cloud-auth.sh\"",
            "timeout": 300
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If `.claude/settings.json` already exists, merge the `SessionStart` hook into the existing `hooks` object. Commit both `.claude/hooks/cloud-auth.sh` and `.claude/settings.json`.

All API calls use `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"` against `https://` endpoints.

### Rollback a Failed Setup

Undo a first-time setup or provider addition that did not finish. Run it from any shell: it reads the account from `.cloud-setup-pending.json` (or `PROJECT_ID`/`SA_EMAIL`). It first removes the account from every binding in the project policy, since bindings of a deleted account linger for up to 60 days, then deletes the account, which deletes its keys with it. A 404 means the account is already gone.

```bash

# operation must match it or be unset (shell values are used only without one)

```

`SA_EMAIL` (`$SA_ID@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`: by default `claude-agent-<random suffix>`, or the ID the user chose) is the identity every later step binds to: grant roles to it, create its key, and record it as `service_account` in `.cloud-config.json`.

## Grant Roles

For each role, read the **full** current policy (version 3), add the binding, and write the same object back. Keeping the fetched `etag`, `version`, and `auditConfigs` matters: `setIamPolicy` replaces the whole policy, a missing `etag` can overwrite a concurrent change, and writing a version-1 policy over a version-3 one drops its conditional bindings.

```bash
ROLE="roles/ROLE_NAME"
# Bind to the account setup actually created (SA_EMAIL from Create Service
# Account), or in a later session the one recorded in config; never a
# hard-coded name, which could be a different, pre-existing account.

### Record the key's owner

A service-account key carries no member label, and its ID is otherwise stored only inside that member's encrypted file. Record which member owns which key in `.cloud-config.json` (the ID is not secret), so the key can be found and deleted when the member leaves even if their passphrase is gone. Run this once `.cloud-config.json` exists (during first-time setup, right after writing it) and commit the config with the `.enc` file:

```bash
# Provider-aware: in multi-provider configs the map lives in the gcp entry.
# The ID is read from the credential itself: the member's encrypted file (KEY
# from SKILL.md), which is what gets committed, and credentials.json. A KEY_ID
# left in this shell by another operation would otherwise be recorded for the
# wrong key, so a preset one must match.

## Key Management

List existing keys (useful if approaching the 10-key limit). Resolve the
configured service account first (do not hard-code `claude-agent`):

```bash
CFG_PROJECT=$(jq -r '(if .providers then (.providers[] | select(.provider=="gcp") | .project_id) else (select(.provider=="gcp") | .project_id) end) // empty' .cloud-config.json 2>/dev/null)
CFG_SA=$(jq -r '(if .providers then (.providers[] | select(.provider=="gcp") | .service_account) else (select(.provider=="gcp") | .service_account) end) // empty' .cloud-config.json 2>/dev/null)
# Once GCP is configured, the config decides: a PROJECT_ID or SA_EMAIL left in
# the shell from another setup would point at another account
if [ -n "$CFG_PROJECT$CFG_SA" ]; then
  [ -z "${PROJECT_ID:-}" ] || [ "$PROJECT_ID" = "$CFG_PROJECT" ] \
    || { echo "ERROR: PROJECT_ID=$PROJECT_ID but this repo is configured for $CFG_PROJECT; nothing done."; exit 1; }
  [ -z "${SA_EMAIL:-}" ] || [ "$SA_EMAIL" = "$CFG_SA" ] \
    || { echo "ERROR: SA_EMAIL=$SA_EMAIL but this repo is configured for $CFG_SA; nothing done."; exit 1; }
  PROJECT_ID="$CFG_PROJECT"; SA_EMAIL="$CFG_SA"
fi
# No fallback to a guessed name: during first-time setup this is the SA_EMAIL
# Create Service Account printed, and a guess could name another account.
[ -n "$PROJECT_ID" ] && [ -n "$SA_EMAIL" ] || { echo "ERROR: set PROJECT_ID and SA_EMAIL (the account Create Service Account created)."; exit 1; }
curl -X GET \
  "https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/$SA_EMAIL/keys" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Delete a member's key (if a team member leaves or a key is compromised). Look the key up in the `key_ids` map ("Record the key's owner"). Setups made before that map existed have no entry: list the keys as above and match the member by the key's `validAfterTime` against the commit that added their `.enc` file (`git log --diff-filter=A --format=%cI -- <file>`); if no key matches unambiguously, ask the user rather than guess. Set `KEY_ID` to the key found and, once the user has confirmed it, `CONFIRM_KEY=1`; a `KEY_ID` the config records for another member is refused. A member's `revoke_pending` list names old keys a rotation could not delete yet; the snippet below deletes those too, since they are still live. It skips `unrevoked` entries marked `ambiguous` (keys that appeared while a create call failed): such a key may belong to a teammate who was onboarding at the same time, so compare it with every `key_ids` value, delete it by hand only if no member has it, then drop the entry.

```bash

# shell, or one holding another setup's PROJECT_ID/SA_EMAIL)

## Activate (Subsequent Sessions)

Decrypt to a session-stable, private path and keep it for the session so Python
Google client libraries (which use Application Default Credentials, not the
gcloud CLI auth store) can authenticate too:

```bash
# Decrypt to the session ADC path here so this snippet is self-contained
# (don't assume SessionStart already left a file behind). KEY/ENC_FILE come
# from the Authenticate workflow.
ADC_KEY="/tmp/gcp-adc-credentials.json"   # decrypted here, never committed
# A preset CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN outranks the activated account in
# gcloud's credential order: clear it here and for the rest of the session
unset CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN
if [ -n "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE" ]; then
  grep -qxF "unset CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN" "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE" 2>/dev/null || \
    echo "unset CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN" >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
fi
# On any failure, leave no repository identity active, as the hook does:

Do **not** delete the decrypted key while the session is using it for ADC; it
lives only in the ephemeral sandbox and is never written to the repo.

## Verify (Smoke Test)

After activating credentials, run this lightweight check to confirm they work:

```bash
# Minting a token exchanges the service-account key with Google, so it fails if
# the key was deleted or disabled, and it needs no project-level API or role.
gcloud auth print-access-token >/dev/null && gcloud config get-value account
```

Then exercise one capability the granted roles actually allow (for example `gcloud storage ls gs://<bucket>/` for a storage role, or `bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'SELECT 1'` for BigQuery). Avoid `gcloud projects describe` as the check: it needs the Cloud Resource Manager API enabled on the project and fails for valid keys where it is off.

If the token step fails, the credentials may be expired or revoked. Re-run the **Authenticate** flow or ask the user to check the service account.
